# Even-Odd-Checker
GUI projects made using Python and Tkinter.

Copy the code and directly run on Vs code or any code editor must sure that python is installed in the device 

* install Tkinter from terminal by using - pip install tkinter
* than paste the code and run it .

 
sorry for the mistake in  vote-eligibility.py.py  name  .py is mistakly added one more time  but dont worry code will run properly  just copy and run on your editor .
